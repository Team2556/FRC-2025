# Radioactive Roaches Team Guide

Welcome to the **Radioactive Roaches**, a high school robotics team dedicated to fostering creativity, technical skills, and leadership through hands-on robotics projects. This guide outlines how our team operates, how students grow through our **Experience Ladder**, and how we welcome and support new members. It serves as a roadmap for students, mentors, and parents to ensure a rewarding and organized experience.

## Mission and Values

- **Mission**: Empower students to learn, innovate, and lead in robotics through collaboration and hands-on experience.
- **Values**: Growth, inclusivity, teamwork, and resilience.
- **Team Charter**: All members commit to respect, effort, and supporting each other’s growth.

## Experience Ladder: Progression and Badges

Every student progresses through the **Experience Ladder**, a structured path that builds skills and responsibilities: **Observer**, **Learner**, **Doer**, **Responsible**. Progression is tracked for each student, and achievements are recognized with **Dosimeter Badges**, styled like dosimeters with increasing "dose counts" to reflect growth.

### Levels and Behaviors

Each level has distinct behaviors, mentor engagement strategies, and expectations to encourage growth.

| Level        | Description                                    | Typical Behaviors                                                                    | Mentor Engagement                                                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Observer     | New to the team, watching and absorbing.       | Asks basic questions, follows instructions, observes processes.                      | Ask: “Does that make sense?” Provide clear explanations, encourage curiosity.           |
| Learner      | Actively learning skills, starting to contribute. | Tries tasks with guidance, asks “why” and “how,” begins to suggest ideas.           | Ask: “What do you think is next?” Guide through tasks, encourage problem-solving.       |
| Doer         | Independently performs tasks, teaches others.   | Executes tasks confidently, helps peers, takes initiative on projects.               | Ask: “Who are you going to teach that to?” Encourage leadership and peer mentoring.     |
| Responsible   | Leads projects, drives team success.           | Plans tasks, delegates, ensures project quality, mentors lower levels.               | Ask: “What does this project need to really succeed?” Support strategic thinking.       |

### Tracking and Badges

- **Tracking**: Mentors maintain a shared spreadsheet to log each student’s current level, skills mastered, and contributions. Regular check-ins (monthly or per project milestone) assess progress.
- **Dosimeter Badges**:
  - **Observer**: Single bar (low dose, ~10 mSv, green).
  - **Learner**: Two bars (~50 mSv, yellow).
  - **Doer**: Three bars (~100 mSv, orange).
  - **Responsible**: Four bars (~200 mSv, red).
- Badges are awarded at team ceremonies (e.g., Induction Ceremony, end-of-season celebration) to celebrate growth.
- Students may be at different levels across sub-teams (e.g., Learner in Mechanical, Observer in Programming).

### Mentor Guidance

- **Assess Progress**: Use behaviors as a rubric. Discuss with students to set goals for the next level.
- **Encourage Growth**: Tailor tasks to stretch students just beyond their current level (e.g., pair Observers with Doers for shadowing).
- **Celebrate Milestones**: Recognize badge awards publicly to motivate the team.

## New Member Program

The **New Member Program** welcomes students and parents, sets expectations, and integrates new members into the team. It aligns with the school year and emphasizes inclusivity, focusing on fit with the team charter rather than aptitude.

### Timeline and Key Events

    - **Skills**: Graphic design, public speaking, event planning.
    - **Tasks**: Create team swag, manage social media, organize demos.

- **Sub-Team Leadership**:
  - **Student Leads** (Responsible level): Each sub-team has a lead who oversees tasks, mentors lower-level members, and reports to the Team Captain and mentors at all-team meetings.
  - **Mentors**: Guide sub-teams, assess progression, and ensure safety. Mentors work closely with Project Owners and the Team Captain to align projects with team goals.

- **Buddy System**:
  - Pairs new members (Observers) with experienced students (Doers or Responsible) for mentorship and integration.
  - Buddies assist during Orientation Week, crash courses, and early build season tasks.

**Action for Team**:
- **Captain Election**: Schedule nominations and voting in October, post-Orientation Week, to ensure candidates are familiar with team dynamics.
- **Project Owner Assignments**: At build season kickoff, mentors and Team Captain assign Project Owners based on game requirements (e.g., one for drivetrain, one for manipulator).
- **Communication**: Team Captain and Project Owners use a shared platform (e.g., Slack, GitHub, Discord) to coordinate tasks and share updates.
